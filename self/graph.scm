;; Finds the strongly-connected components of the graph.  We need this to find
;; out how a pedantic programmer might have grouped a set of functions carefully
;; into letrecs, so that we can isolate such groups - otherwise they're all typed
;; together as a single letrec.  That causes polymorphic instantiation to fail in
;; many cases, because HM disallows polymorphism in recursive functions.  [yes,
;; it's hard to explain]
